## Description
Brick Blaster is a classic 2D arcade-style breakout game built using Unity. The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks while collecting exciting power-ups. Each power-up affects gameplay in unique ways, keeping the game dynamic and challenging.

This game was made as a personal project to practice and learn Unity game development from scratch. All core systems like player health, ball duplication, and power-up management were built using C# scripts.
